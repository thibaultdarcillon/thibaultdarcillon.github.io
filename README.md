I am Thibault Darcillon, an Associate Professor of Economics, (*Maître de conférences HDR*) at [Université Paris VIII (Vincennes - Saint-Denis)](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/). I am a research affiliate at [Laboratoire d'Économie Dionysien](https://sites.google.com/site/up8led/home) (LED, UR 3391). 

I received my PhD in Economics in 2013 from University of Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne and my 'accreditation to supervise research' (*Habilitation à diriger des recherches*) in 2021 from Université de Paris. 

My **research interests** are in questions related to (i) Political Economy; (ii) Financial Economics; (iii) Labor Economics.

- A first strand of my main research is devoted to the **study of transformations in financial systems** in OECD countries. These transformations are examined from a political economy perspective, taking into account the interactions that may exist with the labor market, and thus lie at the intersection of financial economics and labor economics--at both the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels. 
- A second part of my research focuses on analyzing the **determinants of changes in socio-economic cleavages** in developed countries, with particular attention to individual preferences for public policies and their relationship to political preferences.

Within the department of Economics and Management at the Université Paris VIII, I am: 

- Director of the undergraduate program in Economics-Management (*Licence Economie-Gestion*); 
- Member of the LED Council and the *comité consultatif* 

I am one of the co-organizers of the seminar "[Political Economy of Institutional Change](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/evenements/economie-politique-du-changement-institutionnel-epci/)" (Université Paris I/Paris School of Economics).
